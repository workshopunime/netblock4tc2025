<p>Blockchain is revolutionizing the way we establish trust, ensure security, and enable decentralization across digital ecosystems. Its decentralized ledger model allows data and value to be shared and verified across distributed networks without the need for centralized control. Once recorded, transactions become part of an immutable, cryptographically secured sequence—greatly enhancing transparency, accountability, and trust. When combined with complexity science—especially complex network theory—blockchain opens up new perspectives for modeling, analyzing, and strengthening distributed systems. Networked structures such as financial systems, social platforms, criminal networks, and inter-organizational communication can be better understood and optimized using graph-based approaches. These insights pave the way for smarter consensus mechanisms, improved scalability, and more resilient infrastructures. This workshop invites contributions that explore the intersection of blockchain technologies, complex systems, and AI-driven security. We welcome theoretical advances, practical frameworks, and interdisciplinary research that aim to secure the future of networks through innovative, data-driven, and decentralized solutions.</p>

<h3><b>Important Dates</b></h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Submission Deadline:</b>  August 20, 2025 </li>
<li><b>Author Notification:</b>  September 15, 2025 </li>
<li><b>Camera-ready and Registration:</b>  September 30, 2025 </li>
<li><b>Conference Date:</b>  October 30 - November 02, 2025</li>
</ul>

<h3><b>Author Instructions</b></h3>
<p>All papers need to be submitted electronically through the conference submission website
(https://edas.info/N33881) with PDF format. Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with
papers that have been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a
conference with proceedings. Papers must be clearly presented in English, must not exceed 8 
pages in IEEE Computer Society proceedings format (or up to 10 pages with a page over length
charge), including tables, figures, references and appendices. Papers will be selected based on
their originality, significance, relevance, and clarity of presentation assessed by at least three
reviewers. All submitted papers will be judged through double-blind reviews, where the
identities of the authors are withheld from the reviewers. As an author, you are required to
preserve the anonymity of your submission, while at the same time allowing the reader to fully
grasp the context of related past work, including your own. Papers that do not conform to our
double-blind submission policies will be rejected without review.
Submission of a paper should be regarded as a commitment that, should the paper be accepted,
at least one of the authors will register and attend the conference to present the work. IEEE
Blockchain 2025 reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference
(e.g., removal from the digital library and indexing services), if the paper is not presented at
the conference. All accepted papers will be published by the IEEE Computer Society Press (EI
Indexed) and collected by IEEE Xplore Digital Library. Distinguished papers presented at the
conference, after further revision, will be invited for submission to a special issue.</p>

<h3><b>Double-blind Submission</b></h3>
<ul>
<li>Remove the names and affiliations of authors from the title page.</li>
<li>Remove acknowledgments.</li>
<li>Remove project titles or names that could be used to trace back to the authors via web search.</li>
<li>Carefully name your files to anonymize author information.</li>
<li>Carefully refer to related work, particularly your own. Do not omit references to provide
anonymity, as this leaves the reviewer incapable of grasping the context. Instead, reference
your past work in the third person, just as you would any other piece of related work by
another author. For example, instead of "In prior work [1], we presented a scheme that ...,"
sentences in the spirit of "In prior work, Clark et al. [1] presented a scheme that ..." should be
used. With this method, the full citation of the referred paper can still be given, such as "[1]
A. Clark …., "Analysis of...", and it is not acceptable to say "[1] Reference deleted for
double-blind review."</li>
<li>The submitted manuscript or its title/abstract should not be posted on a public website, such
as arxiv.org, or transmitted via public mailing lists.</li>
<li>The submitted manuscript (PDF file) should be text-searchable. Any submission that does not
meet this requirement may be returned without review.</li>
<li>Many of the editing tools automatically add metadata to the generated PDF file containing
information that may violate the double-blind policy. Please remove any possible metadata
that can link your manuscript to you. This includes removing names, affiliations, license
numbers, etc. from the Metadata as well as from the paper. Failing to meet this requirement
may also lead to rejection without review.</li>
